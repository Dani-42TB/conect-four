# Connect four

### What is this?
This is the result of everything I've learned aside from OOP put into practice in one simple program.
It's my rendition of connect four, and the application of all the programming concepts I learned in "Python for absolute begginners" by Talk Python, 
with the plus of everything I've been learning in CS50, and MIT 6.00.1x Intro to CS with Python. 

### Requirements
You only need python's promt-toolkit and the colorama libraries to use this program. This is a CLI program, and it might not work in some teminals incompatible with ANSI colors. colorama initialization should take care of that but it is untested. 

If you wanna play without colors, just edit the player symbols to be an X and and O instead of two O's.
